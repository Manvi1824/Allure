            <p class="box1para">Sanni did my hair and makeup for my wedding in Edinburgh in July 2022. The look she
                created for my day was everything that I wanted it to be and more. Sanni was incredibly helpful in the
                build-up to my wedding, with excellent communication and helping with timings etc. Sanni was such a
                bright and calming energy on the morning of my wedding. I was so grateful to have her as part of our
                special day and wouldn't hesitate to recommend her hair and makeup services!</p>

            <p class="box1para">“Sanni was recommended to me by my wedding planner. I don’t normally wear make-up and so
                had no idea what to expect. Sanni was so professional and immediately understood my concern. After the
                trial, I was in awe at how natural and beautiful I look in make-up. My husband especially couldn’t stop
                complimenting! I knew Sanni was the one! Not only she is so knowledgable and professional, she has great
                personality and positive vibes! We immediately hit it off during the trial!</p>
            <p class="box1para">On the day, she made me feel so calm and it was really fun to be around her. We had a
                blast! It felt like having a good friend around. My make-up on the day, I have no words to describe!
                Sanni made me feel like the most beautiful princess but still looking like myself. I really LOVE her
                work! My husband cried when he saw me walking down the aisle. I received so many compliments from
                streets people while we were out shooting! I felt like a model on the day!</p>
            <p class="box1para">Thank you so much Sanni! I really enjoy my time with you and you made the getting ready
                part so memorable and fun! It was a very special day for us and we are so glad you were a part of it!
                Thank you so so much Sanni! x</p>

                beautiful it turned out! She was absolutely amazing to work with. We had great communication leading up
                to my big day and she was always quick to respond and very professional. Not only is she incredibly
                talented, but she is also super sweet, chill, and so fun and easy to work with. I felt like I had a
                close friend helping me get ready. I had zero stress the day of; it was so relaxing and fun getting
                ready with her. She also did my mom and aunt’s hair and makeup and they looked fabulous! I wanted a very
                natural look and it turned out better than I could have ever expected! Everyone raved about how
                beautiful I looked and how gorgeous my hair turned out. Sanni went above and beyond and was super
                helpful along the way. She had an extensive selection of makeup and products that were all very high
                end. Thank you Sanni for truly making me look and feel the most beautiful I’ve ever felt in my life! My

            <p class="box1para">Just wanted to tell you that I got SOOOO many compliments on the makeup today!! I wish I
                could learn your skill but certainly I don’t have it. Please let me know if any products or tools you
                think I MUST have. The pics are gorgeous from the sneak peaks and I can’t wait to see the rest. I’ll def

                felt beautiful, not too “geisha”, but perfect. you rocked the hair and she looked incredible. As we
                walked the streets people asked if she was a real bride or a model… thank you for helping us be stable

                was already sure during the session that I would definitely have you as my MUA on my big day! You made
                me feel totally at ease and I simply loved the vibes around you! You addressed my concerns and made me
                look flawless :) I was also very impressed that you took an extra step that you paid a lot of attention
                on my bridesmaids' preferences. You took care of us 3 very well and we had just an enjoyable morning
                getting ready! It did set us up on an ultra good mood for the day. I would recommend you to any brides

            <p class="box2para">"Sanni is in my opinion the best make up artist in Paris. I recommend her to all of my
                clients because not only she is fun and her energy is uplifting before a shoot but also because she is
                an expert at knowing how to highlight your best features for the camera. She knows what will look the
                best on film but also she is a great listener and will adjust the makeup until you are truly confident

            <p class="box2para">“With so many things that can go wrong at your wedding, how you look and feel shouldn’t
                be one of them! I watched a few of her videos on youtube and felt like her approach was so natural and
                adaptable and as a clean freak I really loved her video on cleaning her tools and kits. I told Sanni
                that I wanted to look like the best version of me, very vague, but with a friendly approach and
                thoughtful questions we were able to come up with what that look meant. The result was me feeling like
                the most beautiful version of myself and ladies, she doesn’t mess around - I got ready at noon and was
                still fresh as a daisy at 3am (as were all of my bridesmaids) and this was after a warm summer wedding
                and a lot of happy tears.</p>
